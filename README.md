# Scripts

Hello, this is a random collection of my utility scripts.

## Structure

The repository contains scripts that are ideally self-contained.
There will be a separate README if the script requires additional setup.

## Language and Setup

For JavaScript, you will need Node.js installed.
The LTS version 18 should suffice to run all scripts.

## Important Note

These scripts are not tested against edge cases.
They are not guaranteed to work bug-free.
Use them at your own risk.
